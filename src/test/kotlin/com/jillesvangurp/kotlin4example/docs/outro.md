For more elaborate examples of using this library, checkout my 
[kt-search](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search) project. That 
project is where this project emerged from and all markdown in that project is generated by kotlin4example. Give it a 
try on one of your own projects and let me know what you think.
