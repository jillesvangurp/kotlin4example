For more elaborate examples of using this library, checkout my 
[kt-search](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search) project. That 
project is where this project emerged from and all markdown in that project is generated by kotlin4example. Give it a try on one of your own projects and let me know what you think.

## Why another documentation tool?

When I started writing documentation for my [Kotlin Client for Elasticsearch](https://githubcom/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client), I quickly discovered that keeping the
examples in the documentation working was a challenge. I'd refactor or rename something which then would invalidate
all my examples. Staying on top of that is a lot of work.

Instead of just using one of the many documentation tools out there that can grab chunks of source code based on
some string marker, I instead came up with a **better solution**: Kotlin4example implements a **Markdown Kotlin DSL** that includes a few nifty features, including an `example` function that takes an arbitrary block of Kotlin code and turns it into a markdown code block.

So, to write documentation, you simply use the DSL to write your documentation in Kotlin. You don't have to write all of it in Kotlin of course; it can include regular markdown files as well. But when writing examples, you just write them in Kotlin and the library turns them into markdown code blocks.

There is of course more to this library. For more on that, check out the examples below. Which are of course generated with this library.
